        <p>
          I want to create a platform for technical recruitment that focuses on
          the need of the developer looking for a job. It should be easy to find
          relevant jobs, tracking progress with those you get in contact with,
          and then spread the word about which companies do well or not. It's
          like any other tech rec production, but it puts the developer in
          center instead of the companies.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tech stack will revolve around Rust as that is the programming
          language I'm focusing on right now. I will go towards an
          ES/CQRS/DDD-inspired setup with low-tech tools where possible. The
          code architecture will be highly modular, and I'll try to motivate the
          structure in a series of articles about each module in the project.
        </p>

        <header><h3>Case study of io/error</h3></header>
        <p>
          The io/error mod normalizes errors from third party libraries into one
          uniform structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The io/error is then converted into an error that suits the outgoing
          transport layer. For example, HTTP will return status codes while some
          other transport might use enum strings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation from third party error to io/error is done inside the
          other io mods. This is one of the reasons why we wrap all the
          input/output (effectful) libraries. Another reason is to preconfigure
          an http server or a database so that it's easier to use in a safe and
          efficient way, which will be our next topic.
